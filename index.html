        <h3 class="line">About Me</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col s6"><p>I am 27 years old Colombian that graduated in Babson Park, FL with a Business Administration degree. I worked for a personal finance startup in Colombia called Bankity where I did Digital Marketing for almost a year, since then I fell in love with the Startup world, and I decided to start learning code by myself on free time.
                    
                    I picked up html and css very quickly and started to learn javascript, where I started to really understand what programming is all about, I did all the codecademy courses and freecodecamp.org, but I felt that I needed more.
                    </p></div>
            <div class="col s6"><p>I came back to the US and started looking for Job opportunities with no luck, so I saw a this program on indeed to become a front-end developer called Innovate Birmingham, they were going to have a Bootcamp, I did some research and found out that in Birmingham there was a lot of demand for developers, so without doubts I decided to focus all the money I had at that time and leave florida, so drove 9 hours to accomplish my dream. It was a long acceptance progress but I made it through a ⅙ chance to join the program.</p></div>
